# NFT Gallery

- Developed a frontend application to show the NFTs in a wallet on Ethereum blockchain, based on JavaScript and React
- Utilized web3.js library to validate the wallet address
- Used Alchemy SDK to get the data of the NFTs in a wallet

## Steps to run the application:

1. Download the source code.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Create a .env file in the project directory, with your Alchemy API key. Sample .env file as below:

```sh
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

4. In the project directory, run `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

\* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
